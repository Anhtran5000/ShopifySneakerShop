On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. 
We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). 
When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. 
Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 


a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 

The calculations are wrong because initally used is incorrect where they calucated with using the total revenue/the number of order number, which resulted in $3145.13 

To find the AOV, can always double check for the formula


b. What metric would you report for this dataset?

AOV= Total Sum of Revenue/ Total Sum of Order Amount

AOV= $15,725,640/ $43,936

c. What is its value?
$357.92
